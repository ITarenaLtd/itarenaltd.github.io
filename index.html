            <li>
                <b>No Data Collection:  </b>

                We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. All your media files stay safely on your device, and we never transmit them to our servers—or anyone else’s.

            <li>
              <b> Media Access: </b>  

To function properly, the App may request permission to access your photo gallery, but this is strictly for local use. Your photos never leave your device, and we don’t use them for analytics, marketing, or any other purposes.

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Third-Party Services:  </b>  

Our app does not use any third-party services or SDKs that track your activity.

               <b>  Children's Privacy:</b>

Because we do not collect data, our app complies with child privacy regulations by default and can be safely used by users of all ages.
